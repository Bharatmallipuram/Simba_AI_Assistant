The intricate architecture, including 24 carat white marble, precious jewels, and gold-leaf decorations, is one of the Seven Wonders of the World.\n\nThe mausoleum is built on an artificial hillside and features four minarets, each with a towering dome, making it the most impressive structure in India. The tomb consists of a white marble chamber with intricately carved jali (fan) screens, ornate columns, and exquisite carvings.\n\nTaj Mahal is open to visitors throughout the day, but admission can be difficult to secure as it attracts large numbers of tourists during peak hours. The complex also underwent extensive renovations in 1983-84, which included restoration work on the mausoleum and the construction of a new visitors' hall.\n\nOverall, Taj Mahal is a testament to the opulence and artistry of Mughal architecture.
